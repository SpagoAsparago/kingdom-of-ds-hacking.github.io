## Cy's Hex Macros

For Platinum, if 2x speed is enough for your needs, you can use [Cy's Hex Macros](https://github.com/dev-cyw/Cy-s-Hex-Macros/releases/tag/v1.2).

Run the program and select the arm9.bin in your DSPRE's extracted folder, then click the appropriate button. When you load your project in DSPRE in order to export the ROM, remember to **not** re-extract it.


## Hex Editing
If you're using HGSS or want a different speed for Platinum, you need to hex edit.

### Extracting the files

* Platinum:
Since Platinum overlays aren't compressed, you can just use the *overlay_0016.bin* file in the *YourROMNAme_DSPRE_contents/overlay* folder generated by DSPRE. Alternatively you can extract it with Tinke.

* HGSS:
HGSS overlays are compressed instead, so you can use CrystalTile2 to extract them already decompressed.
After you've loaded your ROM, click the NDS icon in the top bar, it should open a window called *NDS filesystem information*. From there, select *overlay_0022.bin*, right click and select *Extract (U)*

### Changing the Speed

Open the overlay in a hex editor, then go to the following address:

* Platinum: `0x2D046`
* HGSS: `0x2E17A`

Then, change the byte you see with the following one depending on the speed you want to have:
-  `80 01` [x0.25]
-  `C0 01` [x0.5]
-  `40 02` [x2]
-  `80 02` [x4]
-  `C0 02` [x8]

### Reinserting the files
