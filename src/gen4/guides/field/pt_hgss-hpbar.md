## Cy's Hex Macros

For Platinum, if 2x speed is enough for your needs, you can use [Cy's Hex Macros](https://github.com/dev-cyw/Cy-s-Hex-Macros/releases/tag/v1.2).

Run the program and select the arm9.bin in your DSPRE's extracted folder, then click the appropriate button. 
When you load your project in DSPRE in order to export the ROM, remember to **not** re-extract it.


## Hex Editing
If you're using HGSS or want a different speed for Platinum, you need to hex edit the appropriate files. All offsets provided are based on the US ROM(s) and might be different on another version.

### Extracting the files

* Platinum:
Since Platinum overlays aren't compressed, you can just use the *overlay_0016.bin* file in the *YourROMNAme_DSPRE_contents/overlay* folder generated by DSPRE. Alternatively you can extract it with Tinke.

* HGSS:
HGSS overlays are compressed instead, so you can use CrystalTile2 to extract them already decompressed.
After you've loaded your ROM, click the NDS icon in the top bar, it should open a window called *NDS filesystem information*. From there, select *overlay_0022.bin*, right click and select *Extract (U)*

### Changing the Speed

Open the overlay in a hex editor, then go to the following offset:

* HGSS: `0x2E17A`
* Platinum: `0x2D046`

Then, replace the bytes at this offset with the following sequence, depending on the speed you want to have:

<details> 
 <summary>HGSS</summary>
 
| Byte Sequence  | Speed |
| ------------- | ------------- |  
| 80 01 | x0.25 |
| C0 01 | x0.5  | 
| 40 02 | x2  | 
| 80 02 | x4  | 
| C0 02 | x8  | 

</details>

<details> 
 <summary>Platinum</summary>
 
| Byte Sequence  | Speed |
| ------------- | ------------- |  
| 88 1E | x2 |
| C8 1E | x3  | 
| 08 1F | x4  | 
| 48 1F | x5  | 
| 88 1F | x6  | 
| C8 1F | x7  | 

</details>

If you want to customize your speed:


### Reinserting the files

* For Platinum, if you edited the overlay in DSPRE's content folder, just load your ROM in DSPRE and export it. Remember to **not** re-extract the contents. If you extracted the overlay with Tinke, just do the same steps you did for extracting it, but this time use the *Change File* button and select your extracted overlay you modified.
* For HGSS, in CrystalTile's NDS filesystem information window, you can select the files you previously extracted, right click and this time click *Compression* and select your own hex edited files. After you're done you can use `File>Build ROM...` to save your ROM.
