This is a tutorial on how to export and import buildings in gen 5 games.
You will need to have installed (CTRMap-CE)[https://github.com/kingdom-of-ds-hacking/CTRMapV/releases] as well as the (CTRMapV)[https://github.com/kingdom-of-ds-hacking/CTRMapV/releases] plugin, then create a project of your the game you want to import/export buildings to/from if you haven't already.

The first thing you want to do is load the map you want to export/import your building(s) using the Zone Loader, then open the building editor by clicking the Pok√©mon Center icon in the World Editor's top bar, and then click *Edit Resource Bundle*
## Exporting Buildings
Select the building you want to export from the list on the left side of the editor, then click the *Open in CS* button right below. This will launch Creative Map studio, from where you can export the model in a number of different formats, using the *Export* options from the top bar.

About the different file types you can get, it's worth mentioning:
* COLLADA: exports as **DAE** format
* NNS Resource: exports as NSBMD, Nintendo's proprietary format
* WaveFront OBJ: exports as **OBJ** format

If you're planning to import the building in a gen 4 game, you should export as either OBJ or NNS resource since PDSMS and DSPRE building editors cannot import DAE models.

### Subsection 2

Inserting images works as well. Any method that clearly presents the image should be just fine.
