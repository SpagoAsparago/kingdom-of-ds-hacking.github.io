# How to insert custom maps and their textures in Gen V games
> This guide was written by Gonhex and was formatted for this wiki by SpagoAsparago

This is a tutorial on how to insert your own maps in generation 5 games, as well as change the Area Data textures.
It is assumed you have already made your map in PDSMS or Blender and have all the files already converted. If you're unsure how to do so, check Jay's video on map making using PDSMS.

## Locating the Matrix
First you want to find out which matrix you want to insert your new maps into, and check if there is available space or you need a new matrix. If it's Matrix 0, you don't need to do anyting else. If you want to insert your map next to an adiacent existing map but it's not on Matrix 0, open the latter map header on CTRMap Header Editor, and check what Matrix is listed there.
